# Discord Gruvbox Theme
By Fluffy Bean and mrHDash

Info
---------
1. This was made possible by Better Discords Recolour Theme, all I simply did was change the colours so don't thank me
2. I was first inspired to make this theme when I saw [Druvbox](https://github.com/CircuitRCAY/Duvbox)
3. The Gruvbox palette also wasn't made by me, [here's](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) a link to the palette
4. And lastly you will need [Better Discord](https://betterdiscord.app/) installed to use this theme

How to use
---------
Once Better Discord installed
1. Go to user settings
2. Under Better Discord options go to Themes
3. Open the file location of themes
4. Put the downloaded files into there

Now you should be able to use the Gruvbox theme!
